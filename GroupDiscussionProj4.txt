CIS200 - Group Project
Plan: 8/8/2019
Dealer will inherit attributes of player.
Game will recieve bets from players
and then set bets.
AI player will always set the same bet.
House play will utilize functions from Player class.

Eric Charnesky Advice:
The dealer has a hand of cards, and always goes last.
If they have 16 or less, they will always hit.
Once the dealeris done taking cards, the players who have
not gone over 21 will win if their total is > than the
dealer total. If they tie, they get their bet back and
don't lose anything.
